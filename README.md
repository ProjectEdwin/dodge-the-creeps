# 🎮 Dodge the Creeps (ProjectEdwin Edition)

An indie, learning-in-public game project built with **Godot 4.6**.

This game **started as Godot’s official “Dodge the Creeps” tutorial**, and is slowly evolving into its *own thing* as I learn more about game development, one experiment (and bug) at a time.

If you’re here to:
- play a simple but escalating survival game  
- learn Godot by example  
- see what “learning in public” looks like  
- or just dodge some creeps  

…you’re in the right place.

## 🎯 How to Play

**Goal:**  
Survive as long as possible and beat your own **Best (hi-score)**.

**Controls:**
- Move: **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**
- New Game / Restart: **Enter** or **Mouse Click**
